            <h1>HERE ARE MY CAREER GOALS!</h1>
            <p>For my career one day I'd like to be a progamer / coder. Specifically I'd like to be one of the people who code the maps for things like google earth
                or even the government for the military to use. I really love geography and I've taken quite a liking to coding. In fact coding is what I want to do for
                my college major. As a coder I would be responsible for creating the programs that people would be using like the website that you're on right now or
                more complex programs like microsoft paint to give a few examples. That is my career goal and what it is.
