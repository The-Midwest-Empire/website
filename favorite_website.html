                My favorite website is Youtube. This is because I spend lots of time on that website watching lots of different types of content.
                its where I remain in touch with current events that are going on as well as giving me something to do in my spare time. I've also learned a ton
                from youtube for things like history knowledge, computer knowledge, and many more things. Youtube is a geat site and one that I hope never goes away.
